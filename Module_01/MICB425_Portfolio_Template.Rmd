### RMarkdown pretty PDF challenge
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


The following assignment is an exercise for the reproduction of this .html document using the RStudio and RMarkdown tools we've shown you in class. Hopefully by the end of this, you won't feel at all the way this poor PhD student does. We're here to help, and when it comes to R, the internet is a really valuable resource. This open-source program has all kinds of tutorials online.

##Challenge Goals
The goal of this R Markdown html challenge is to give you an opportunity to play with a bunch of different RMarkdown formatting. Consider it a chance to flex your RMarkdown muscles. Your goal is to write your own RMarkdown that rebuilds this html document as close to the original as possible. So, yes, this means you get to copy my irreverant tone exactly in your own Markdowns. It's a little window into my psyche. Enjoy =)


**hint: go to the [PhD Comics website](http://phdcomics.com/) to see if you can find the image above**  
*If you can't find that exact image, just find a comparable image from the PhD Comics website and include it in your markdown*



###Here's a header!


Let's be honest, this header is a little arbitrary. But show me that you can reproduce headers with different levels please. This is a level 3 header, for your reference (you can most easily tell this from the table of contents).


####Another header, now with maths

Perhaps you're already really confused by the whole markdown thing. Maybe you're so confused that you've forgotten how to add. Never fear! ~~A calculator~~ R is here:
```{r}
1231521+12341556280987
```


###Table Time


Or maybe, after you've added those numbers, you feel like it's about time for a table!  
I'm going to leave all the guts of the coding here so you can see how libraries (R packages) are loaded into R (more on that later). It's not terribly pretty, but it hints at how R works and how you will use it in the future. The summary function used below is a nice data exploration function that you may use in the ^future^.
```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars), caption="I made this table with kable in the knitr package library")  
```


And now you've almost finished your first RMarkdown! Feeling excited? We are! In fact, we're so excited that maybe we need a big finale eh? Here's ours! Include a fun gif of your choice!

## Origins and Earth Systems
### Evidence Worksheet 01 


[Whitman *et al* 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC33863/)

#### Learning objectives
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems. 

#### General questions
#####**What were the main questions being asked?** 

* What is the total number of prokaryote cells in the world?
* How much of the world's carbon is made up by prokaryotes?
* What are the major environments in which these prokaryotes live?
* How does the number if prokaryotes contribute to genetic diversity?
* How does the turnover time vary by environment?

#####**What were the primary methodological approaches used?**

* Performing calculations on data provided in literature cited to provide estimate on prokaryote counts in various representative environments and other habitats
* Extrapolating from equations in literature cited to estimate prokaryote numbers in less accessible environments such as deep sediments
* Creating a depth profile for unconsolidated sediments for subsurface prokaryotes in deep ocean, continential shelf/slope and terrestrial coastal plain using calculated arithmetic averages
* Using assumptions from literature cited regarding the volume and average porosity of the terrestrial subsurface, total pore space occupied by prokaryotes, and average volume of a subsurface prokaryote cell to calculate the total number of terrestrial subsurfadce prokaryotes

#####**Summarize the main results or findings.**

* The habitats that the greatest number of prokayotes are generally categorized as being part of the subsurface (seawater, soil, sediments)
* The total carbon in prokaryotes is estimate to be around 60-100% of the total carbon found in plants
* Terrestrial plants have a lower nutrient (Nitrogen/Phosphorus-containing) content per gram of carbon than soil prokaryotes do
* Mutations are more prevalent in prokaryotes because of their sheer numbers, leading to greater genetic diverty
* Although animals, leaves, and plant tissue have a large resident prokaryote propulation, the scale of those populations are too low to form a major portion of the total number of prokaryotes in the world
    - Eg: Soil has significantly more prokaryotes than leaves do.
    
#####**Do new questions arise from the results?**

* What proportion of the total number of prokaryotes is archaea? 
* What propotion of the total number of prokaryotes is bacteria?
* Is there any way to have a better estimate of the total number of prokaryotes in this day and age better computational tools at our disposal? * How does the prokaryote nutrient pool (C/N/P) differ in the ocean compared to terrestrial environments?

#####**Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (*e.g.* did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)?**  


The authors provided a very brief background on what prokaryotes do and how they contribute to genetic diversity, but then quickly goes into describing their methodology as well as the various environments they looked at. However, they explained **how** they know there are lots of prokaryotes in these environments and not **why**, which can be confusing to readers that do not know what prokaryotes are.


The methods were quite vague as they do mention that they extrapolate from the equations of the cited literature, which requires looking at them and determining what they did, especially for unconsolidated sediments. There were assumptions made regarding the porosity of subsurface sediments, pore space taken up by prokaryotes and the volume of prokaryotes, which were used to estimate the total number of prokaryotes in those environments. 


The tables provided were neat and easy to understand and compare the number of prokaryotes in each environment. It also provided a quick way visualizing a calculation that they did to arrive at the total number of prokaryotic cells. Seeing the total number of the cells does not seem far-fetched since the Earth has a high volume in which many small prokaryotic cells can live in.

    + Hadean  
        + Meteorite impacts throughout this eon 
        + More CO~2~ as evidenced by limestone and much higher vapour pressure due to higher temperatures (500Â°C)
        + Temperature started to cool down even more closer to the end of the eon (100Â°C)
        + Surface ocean temperatures were about 100Â°C
        + Silica-containing rocks provided evidence for waters in the ocean because the lithosphere would need to be hydrated and cooled for these rocks to form.
    + Archean

            + The large amount of CH~4~ is necessary for the Earth as a greenhouse gas because keeps the heat on Earth especially when the sun was 33% dimmer; was produced in levels 10-100x higher before O~2~ became common in the atmosphere

            + CH~4~ could be used to build biomass

### Problem set 01
#### Learning objectives: 
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to the ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems.

#### Specific questions:
#####**What are the primary prokaryotic habitats on Earth and how do they vary with respect to their capacity to support life? Provide a breakdown of total cell abundance for each primary habitat from the tables provided in the text.**


The primrary prokaryotic habitats on Earth are **aquatic environments** (both fresh water and marine) across various regions in the open ocean and sediments, which has a total prokaryotic cell abundance of 1.2 x 10^29^, **soil**, which has a total prokaryotic cell abundance of 2.6 x 10^29^, and **subsurface**, which has a total prokaryotic cell abundance of 4.9 x 10^30^.


#####**What is the estimated prokaryotic cell abundance in the upper 200 m of the ocean and what fraction of this biomass is represented by marine cyanobacterium including Prochlorococcus? What is the significance of this ratio with respect to carbon cycling in the ocean and the atmospheric composition of the Earth?** 


The estimated cell abundance of prokaryotic cells in the upper 200m of the ocean is 3.6 x 10^28^ and marine autotrophs make up 8% of those prokaryotic cells. This is significant as the autotrophs control the majority of the primary production in the ocean and provides oxygen to the atmosphere and carbon to marine heterotrophic bacteria.


#####**What is the difference between an autotroph, heterotroph, and a lithotroph based on information provided in the text?**


Autotrophs are "self-nourishing" organisms that can fix inorganic carbon into biomass  
Heterotrophs are organisms that can assimilate orgnaic carbon  
Lithotrophs are organisms that can use inorganic substrates 


#####**Based on information provided in the text and your knowledge of geography what is the deepest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this depth? ** 


The deepest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life is in the terrestrial subsurface where it can reach depths up to 4 km, as mentioned in the text. For marine environments, the deepest environment is the Marianas Trench, which is around 10.9 km deep, and possibly 5-6 km deeper before the temperature reaches the limiting factor of having an average temperature of 125 degrees celsius. 


#####**Based on information provided in the text your knowledge of geography what is the highest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this height?**  


The highest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life is at 57-77 km in the atmosphere, but the abundance is relatively low because the oxygne concentration at that height is relatively low. There could also be a low amount of water vapour, which maybe needed by those prokaryotes.


#####**Based on estimates of prokaryotic habitat limitation, what is the vertical distance of the Earth's biosphere measured in km?**


The vertical distance of the Earth's biosphere is measured to be around 57-77 km in the atmisohere due to prokaryotes being detected at those heights.


#####**How was annual cellular production of prokaryotes described in Table 7 column four determined? (*Provide an example of the calculation*)**


It was determined by dividing the number of days in the year (365) by the turnover time and then multiplying it by the population size.


Example (for Marine Heterotrophs living above 200m  ; Turnover time = 16 days; Population size = 3.6 x 10^28^):

$$\frac{365 \ days/year}{16 \ days} \cdot{3.6\times 10^{28}} \ Cells = 8.2\times 10^{29} \ Cells/year$$ 


A large number of these prokaryotes are lysed by marine viruses.


#####**What is the relationship between carbon content, carbon assimilation efficiency and turnover rates in the upper 200m of the ocean? Why does this vary with depth in the ocean and between terrestrial and marine habitats?** 


Carbon efficincy = 20%  
5-20 fg C/cell  
$$3.6\times 10^{28} \ cells \cdot{6\times 10^{-30}} \ Pg \ C /cell = 0.72 \ Pg \ C$$
Pg C in Marine Environments


$$0.72 \ Pg \ C\times{4} = 2.88 \ Pg \ C$$


#####**How were the frequency numbers for four simultaneous mutations in shared genes determined for marine heterotrophs and marine autotrophs given an average mutation rate of 4 x 10^-7^ per DNA replication? (Provide an example of the calculation with units. Hint: cell and generation cancel out)**


To account for the chance of having four simultaneous mutations in shared genes for marine heterotrophs above a depth of 200m:
$$(4\times 10^{-7})^{4} \ mutations/gene/DNA \ replication = 2.56\times10^{-26} \ $$


To
$$3.6\times 10^{28} \ Cells \cdot 22.8 \ year^{-1} = 8.2\times 10^{29} \ Cells/year$$
$$8.2\times 10^{29} \cdot 2.56\times 10^{-26} = 2.1\times 10^{4} \ {mutations/year}$$

#####**Given the large population size and high mutation rate of prokaryotic cells, what are the implications with respect to genetic diversity and adaptive potential? Are point mutations the only way in which microbial genomes diversify and adapt?**


* Having a large population size, increases the mutation rate significantly, thereby increasing genetic diversity since more mutations can give rise to new traits, which can be helpful for adapting to a new environment. This increases adaptive potential. Although point mutations can be largely silent, they have the ability to diversify microbial genomes, and they are not the only mode since there is also horizontal gene transfer, which can happen with microbes.


#####**What relationships can be inferred between prokaryotic abundance, diversity, and metabolic potential based on the information provided in the text?**




### Problem set 02
#### Specific Questions:
##### **What are the primary geophysical and biogeochemical processes that create and sustain conditions for life on Earth? How do abiotic versus biotic processes vary with respect to matter and energy transformation and how are they interconnected?**


Tectonic movement along with photochemical reactions in the atmosphere allow for mixing and partitioning of chemical substrates on Earth. 


Geophysical (abiotic): Tectonics (Acid/base), transfer of protons without electrons, atmospheric photochemical processes (photochemistry/radical chemistry = âmagicâ)
Biogeochemical: 
 (Redox)
 
 
##### **Why is the Earth's redox state considered an emergent property?**


The Earth's redox state is considered an emergent property as it is reliant on reactions that occur in the Earth's (bio)geochemical processes that occur due to regular chemical redox reactions and the metabolic processes of microbes. No single organism in these processes possess all the components that is needed to run these systems, and it is instead the reactions that occur, which are connected to each other that make up the processes as a whole.


##### **How do reversible electron transfer reactions give rise to element and nutrient cycles at different ecological scales? What strategies do microbes use to overcome thermodynamic barriers to reversible electron flow?**


Reversible electron transfer reactions give rise to element and nutrient cycles because of the thermodynamic conditions that make each reaction favorable. Specifically, the rate at which each reaction occurs is determined by the conditions of the environment (i.e. abundance of substrates, products, et. cetera) thus allowing for nutrients to cycle in a stable manner. 


##### **Using information provided in the text, describe how the nitrogen cycle partitions between different redox ânichesâ and microbial groups. Is there a relationship between the nitrogen cycle and climate change?**


The different stages of the nitrogen cycle all require different amounts of oxygen, corresponding to different redox niches, and the other microbes that will be in that environment. In nitrogen fixation, nitrogen gas is fixed from our atmosphere into ammonium. This is done by nitrogenase, which is inhibited by oxygen, yet this is still done in many microbes in aerobic environments. Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite and finally nitrate, happens in aerobic environments. Denitrification, the anaerobic oxidation of nitrate and nitrite to nitrogen gas, occurs in anoxic/anaerobic environments.


Indirectly, the nitrogen cycle is connected to climate change. All microbes require nitrogen to synthesize protein and nucleic acids, and the only method of nitrogen fixation is via microorganisms. The nitrogen cycle is what controls the amount of available fixed nitrogen, which in turn affects the number of microbes carrying out various other reactions, which in turn produces the Earthâs atmosphere. Additionally, if something were to shift in the nitrogen cycle and affect those microbes involved, it would in turn affect the overall microbial community. The nitrogen cycle does not directly affect climate change, as only nitrogen and hydrogen gas are emitted during nitrogen fixation, nitrification, or denitrification, neither of which are greenhouse gases.


##### **What is the relationship between microbial diversity and metabolic diversity and how does this relate to the discovery of new protein families from microbial community genomes?**


Although there is enormous genetic diversity in nature, there remains a relatively stable
set of core genes coding for the major redox reactions essential for life and biogeochemical cycles. Thus, microbial diversity does not necessarily entail diversity in proteins involved in metabolism. 


It is hypothesized that there is limitless evolutionary diversity in nature. The rate of discovery of unique protein families has been proportional to the sampling effort, with the number of new protein families increasing approximately linearly with the number of new genomes sequenced.

##### **On what basis do the authors consider microbes the guardians of metabolism?**


Temporary and simultaneous guardianship because of the nature of microbial evolution from horizontal and vertical gene transfer, which can change which phenotype is dominant at the time. A dominant phenotype protects the metabolic pathway in the environment, and if it does not survive environmental perturbations applying selective pressures on pathway genes, then it will disappear. Humans could possibly replicate the individual pathways, but the overall metabolic biogeochemical processes that control the flow of electrons can only be done by microbes.
