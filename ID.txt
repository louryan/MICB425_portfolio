Test - EOSC 475 notes
Robert Koch - Known for Koch's postulates
- Nobel prize in 1905 for culturing bacteria on gelatin
- Koch's postulates: proofs for infections --> isolate and purify infectious agent and prove it infects the person
	- Problems: No animal models for many infections and can't use on humans due to ethical issues

Certes
- Cultured aerobic bacteria from sediments from a depth of 5100m depth

Russell
- Quantified bacteria in water

Fischer
- Isolated bioluminescent bacteria (genus vibrio fischeri) from fish
- Researched up until 1940 and then again from the 1970s with molecular bilogy
- Discovery of the lux system (lux operon) 

Claude Zobell
- Distribution and physiology

Holger Jannasch
- Hydrothermal vent bacteria (anoxic, sulfur reducing, extremophiles)

Yuri Sorokin
- Bacterial ecology

Marine Microbiology
- More focussed on processes rather than isolates
- Microbes less than 1 microns have high respiration
	- Most microbes were filtered through
- Epifluorescence + microscopy can estimate abundance
	- Add DAPI stain, and then filter
	- Dip in AgNO3 under dark conditions 
- Radio-isotopic methods can determine growth rates through tracking metabolism
	- Radio labelled amino acids to track
- Using Epifluorescence + Radio-isotopic methods proved this even though most bacteria are unculturable

Categories of microbes
- Bacteria
	- Photoautotrophic Cyanobacteria (phytoplankton)
		- Synechococcus spp.
			- Origin of chloroplasts
		- Prochlorococcus spp.
			- Most abundant phytoplankton in the world
		- Trichodesmium spp.
			- Filamentous phytoplankton
		- Anabaena sp.
			- Freshwater; does not appear in the pelagic oceans, but are in mud flats
			- Has N fixation parts
	- Bacteria = heterotrophic prokaryotes in our context
	- Chemolithotrophs
- Archaea
	- Usually associated with extremophiles (ex: hydrothermal vents)
